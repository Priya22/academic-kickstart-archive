# Biography

I am a research stream Masters student in the Computational Linguistics group at the University of Toronto, where I'm supervised by Prof. Graeme Hirst.
I am broadly interested in developing techniques that can help machines interpret, understand and participate in human communication.
I obtained my undergraduate degree in Computer Science and Engineering from National Institute of Technology Surathkal in Karnataka, India, in the May of 2017 and arrived in Toronto 3 months after. 
Apart from work, I like reading non-academic stuff, visiting the city's inexhaustible list of pretty cafes, and catching up on TV shows from the 2000s.
